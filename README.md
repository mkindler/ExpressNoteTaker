# ExpressNoteTaker

## Description

This project utilizes Express to create an application that allows a user to enter, save, and delete notes in a Note Taker platform.  The application is deployed to Heroku, which allows a user to utilize the application from their browser versus just the CLI.

If, however, a user wanted to use their CLI, they are able to open their terminal and run `node server.js`.  Then, in their browser, a user would type `localhost:8000` into the address bar.

The front end was pre-coded and designed using Bootstrap.

## Task

The Note Taker application is intended to allow users to:
* Write and save notes
* Delete unwanted notes

## Usage

This application can be used by anyone who desires a technology-based method for writing, saving, and organizing notes.

## Installation

This application is deployed to and hosted by Heroku, so a user will not be required to install anything additional.

However, if a user wants to use their CLI to run the application, they will be required to run the following commands in their terminal before using `node server.js` and `localhost:8000`:
* `npm install fs`
* `npm install path`
* `npm install express`

## Process

This process was designed using starter code for the frontend of the application, with all backend files needing to be developed.
